## Crumble dis Cookie

Seriously, just think about that phrase for a little bit, then say it a lot but each time switch at least the pace, tone, your body expression. This has a point, at least it does in my head, so I can wait till you are done. Mind blown, mine is! Maybe not, but if you giggled, love cookies and are a decent person let’s crumble. If you don’t like cookies, don’t eat cookies, are a nazi, and/or a shit person then crumble dis fucking cookie. I am not a monster though, if eating a cookie threatens your life or an actual cookie monster mentally scared you, then please understand that I want you to stay. Replace Cookie with what you Crumble, because this is an idea. Exactly what this idea is though is something I have to crumble on.

Back to the point. Maybe I do know what this is going to be, because lately I have been doing a lot of thinking, obviously about cookies. I have to use them in my job(they are great for storing information), I ate two cookies(maybe three cookies today), and read my fortune that was inside a cookie. It was then that I realized cookies are fascinatingly complex/powerful, once you stop drooling and you start crumbling, you realize that cookie context, tone, pace, form, medium, and dimension is some philosophical shit. 

At this point if you don’t get it, there is still hope, it took me a long time to get this point, but I am going to try and speed this up with examples. The crumble dis cookie exercise at the begging, if you got a boy or girl monster, or both, or whatever and it is consensual you could look at it and say ‘crumble dis cookie’ indicating something sexual. On the other hand you could be fighting, and you could tell that monster to ‘crumble dis cookie’ aggressively. One more example, if you are worried that I might be tracking you cookies, you are in luck because I am not, but that tells me you work in tech. Boom, I crumbled dis case wide open, and it is full of cookie puns.

Maybe I am bored, maybe its my shit job, maybe it’s all the shit in the world, or maybe I don’t know why I am doing this. But I don’t care, I bought crumblediscookie dot com, created a twitter handle @crumbledis, setup an email address cookiemonster@crumblediscookie.com. For some reason I have this crumble that I can’t stop, and just because cookies crumble, I plan to bake more fucking cookies.

More info coming soon, please stay tuned.
